This example is the final version of the case study in the SoSym 2011 submission of Catia and Anne on performance antipatterns. An earlier version was used in the ICPE 2011 paper. 

The model contains an initial system with a number of antipatterns as documented in the paper. In addition, it contains a number of systems from the ICPE case study in which one of the antipatterns each has been resolved. For example, in the brs-pa3 files, performance antipattern (PA) number 3 has been resolved. 

The model can be solved with the PCM versiom 3.2 and SimuCom. 

An earlier version was used in our WOSP/SIPEW 2010 paper on antipattern uiltiness. The original sources can be found on the SVN at external\2009AnneCatia\PCM_3.1_workspace\BRS
